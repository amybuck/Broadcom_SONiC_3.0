# Welcome
Welcome to the Software for open networking in the cloud (SONiC) provides mechanisms for configuring and operating the various functions of a switch developed by Broadcom. 

## What is SONiC?
SONiC is a Linux-based, open-source network operating system (NOS) that runs on switches from multiple vendors and ASICs. It bundles
SONiC-hardened networking stacks, and proprietary applications to feature standard Layer 2 (L2) and Layer 3 (L3) protocols, and
integrations within the Dell Technologies ecosystem and partners.

SONiC offers a full suite of network functionality that has been production-hardened in the data centers of some of the largest cloudservice providers. It offers teams the flexibility to create the network solutions they need while leveraging the collective strength of a large ecosystem and community.
